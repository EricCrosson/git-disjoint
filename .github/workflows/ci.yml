# semantic-release is built around the following idea:
#
# > A release consist in running test, defining the version then releasing
#
# - https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/753#issuecomment-384689034
#
# So we perform the following actions from the context of semantic-release plugins:
#
# - push to Cargo
# - compile all target binaries (not yet supported)
# - create GitHub release
