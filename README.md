`git disjoint` groups commits by issue onto unique branches.

## Installing

#### Cargo

```
cargo +nightly install git-disjoint
```

#### Manual

Download a release compatible with your OS and architecture from the [Releases] page, extract the binary, and put it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

[releases]: https://github.com/EricCrosson/git-disjoint/releases/latest

## Assumptions

`git disjoint` may add value to your workflow if you

- use a work tracker (currently supports Jira)
- use GitHub and Pull Requests

## Goals

`git disjoint` automates referencing issues in your development work ([Jira]) so you can focus on development.

## Workflow

1. [Add all your commits to one branch].

   Starting from your repository's default branch, this could look like:

   ```
   git checkout -b now
   ```

   or, if you are using [git-branchless]:

   ```
   git checkout --detach
   ```

1. In each commit message, include a reference to the relevant ticket.

   For example:

   ```
   Ticket: COOL-123
   ```

   or

   ```
   Closes Ticket: COOL-123
   ```

1. When you're ready to:

   1. turn the set of commits addressing each ticket into its own feature branch,
   1. push that branch, and 
   1. create a draft PR,

   run `git disjoint`.

## Caveats

- There's currently no code to handle the case where `git disjoint` tries to operate on a branch that already exists. This can happen if you invoke `git disjoint` twice on the same branch. See [#32].
